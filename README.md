## Instructions

Run app.js to serve the page, then just go to localhost:3000 to view the page.

I use grunt to compile my javascript and scss (mostly because I prefer to use scss). The uncompiled code is in the src folder. The html pages are in app/views.

## Technology used
- AngularJS
- SCSS (with Grunt)
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Node/Express
